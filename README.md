# Data Structures

Data Structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and<br>
the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.<br>
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Structure)

As my personal note and reference, the following data structures with their<br>
implementation and operations shall be covered for my future self or anyone who<br>
might find this useful.<br>

Implementations shall be refactored as and when I learn and gain more insights<br>
into the go programming language.
